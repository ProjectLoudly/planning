## blind test
I conducted a blind listening test by sending the encoded files to 6 people at SPCR.  The listeners did not know which 
file was which since I renamed the files and gave them all the .m4a extension.

Script to produce files: https://github.com/ProjectLoudly/audio-conversion

### Tests
Each vote is marked as a (+) next to the randomized file name.

1. Which of these wav => source file encodings sound better?
    * **Winner**: WAV => FLAC
    * Listeners commented that the audio quality was very close.
	* ++KdZk: wav.m4a
	* +++NEhU: wav.flac

2. Which source file encoding to output encoding sounds better?
    * **Winner**: FLAC => 128k mp3
	* ++++tQGI: flac.128k.mp3
	* +Imul: aac.128k.mp3

3. Which of these FLAC to output encodings sounds better?
    * **Winner**: FLAC => 128k mp3 by a margin
	* +++tQGI: flac.128k.mp3
	* ++TNnf: flac.he-aac.m4a

4. Which of these AAC to output encodings sounds better?
    * **Winner**: AAC => 128k mp3 by a lot
    * This is a surprise to me.  I think the m4a sounds a lot better when there are lots of sounds over each other. Take a listen to 0:45-1:05 in both files.  In the mp3 one, there is a bit of skipping or popping thatâ€™s not present in the m4a.
	* +GyAh: aac.he-aac.m4a
	* +++++Imul: aac.128k.mp3

5. Which of these different source encodings to HE-AAC sound better?
    * **Winner**: FLAC => HE-AAC
	* +++TNnf: flac.he-aac.m4a
	* GyAh: aac.he-aac.m4a

6. Which FLAC to different bitrate mp3s sound better:
    * **Winner**: FLAC => 128k mp3
	* ++++tQGI: flac.128k.mp3
	* ++rBYd: flac.64k.mp3
